	\section*{The Design of \OOS}
	This section of the document will have
	two columns. The first holding the text,
	the second holding images for the reader.
	First this will explain what the Object
	of Study for this document is. Then this
	will cover some background information.
	Finally this will explain my own experience
	using this object.\newpage
	\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
		The Object of Study for this document is the
		default Mumble Client. This software runs on
		a computer in order to open a connection to
		a Murmur Server. This software serves to let
		multiple people talk to each other over computer
		networks, basically it is a light weight discord.\\
		
		
		This software is used to organize general chatrooms,
		enable teams to talk to each other while playing
		games, or just as an overkill VOIP phone. I have
		a murmur server running on my home network from
		my computer for playing video games with my family
		(I could open it to the internet, but I do not need
		to), you see a ping of zero in Figure \ref{fig:mumbleOpen} because the client used to view
		the connections is already on the computer running the
		server so there is no time lost in the network.\\
		
		
		Figure \ref{fig:mumbleOpen} shows the window that opens
		when the Mumble Client is started. I have used this
		software on multiple operating systems, the only
		difference on all of them has been the
		window decorations assigned to the window on
		creation, this is managed however by the window
		manager and has nothing to do with the actual
		software. The software in my experience is exactly
		the same on MS Windows and every distribution
		of Linux that I have run it on.\\
		
		The Mumble Client allows you to disconnect and connect
		to Murmur Servers, rather than only connecting to a
		singular server and disconnecting on close. Each time
		a connection is made from a client to a server, the
		user is prompted for a user-name. This user-name will
		serve to identify the messages from the user, and
		when the user is speaking, an indicator based on the
		user-name will toggle to show that there is audio
		coming from that user. Figure \ref{fig:mumbleConnected}
		shows the window after connecting to the server.\\
		
		A nice little feature shown in Figure
		\ref{fig:mumbleRecording} is that the Mumble client
		can record audio and save the file locally. One thing
		to mention about the Murmur Server and Mumble Clients
		is that they allow the use of multiple chat rooms under
		the Root in a tree structure.

		Interface Customization & \begin{minipage}{0.7\textwidth}
			The desktop Mumble interface is fully customizable.
		\end{minipage}. \\\\
		Positional Audio & \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
			When running the Mumble Client in a supported
			game, audio from people playing the same game will
			sound as if it came from their in-game location.
		\end{minipage}. \\\\
		\rowcolor{gray}
		Opus Codec & \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
			Use of the free Opus Codec by default prioritizes
			low-latency and high-quality audio transmission.
		\end{minipage}. \\\\
		Noise Suppression & \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
			When connected to a chat-room, noise below a
			chosen threshold will not be broadcast.
		\end{minipage}. \\\\
		\rowcolor{gray}
		Automatic Level Balancing & \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
			At the server, attempts are made to set all volumes
			from each user to an equal level in order to
			prevent one user drowning out all others when
			talking.
		\end{minipage}. \\\\

			volume from other applications while receiving
			audio from other users.

		Encryption & \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
			All data transmitted to and from the server
			is encrypted, this ensures that the privacy of the
			group is legally protected from those disconnected
			from the server.
		\end{minipage}. \\\\
		\rowcolor{gray}
		Setup Wizards & \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
			At set up of the client for the first time, a

		\rowcolor{gray}
		Server List & \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
			Mumble has a public server list sorted by nation
